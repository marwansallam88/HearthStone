Developed a modular, object-oriented card game simulator in Java based on Blizzard's Hearthstone, following strict package architecture and encapsulation principles.

Designed and implemented core game logic, including card types (minions/spells), hero classes, game engine, and custom exceptions for rule enforcement.

Loaded dynamic card data from CSV files, built hero-specific decks with randomization logic, and handled data validation and constraints.

Used Java Swing to develop a basic GUI interface to simulate card interactions, gameplay flow, and state transitions.

Applied OOP concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism to model complex game mechanics in a maintainable and extensible way.
